Angular Boiler Plate Application

**[ View the example page](http://jeremymorgan.github.io/AngularStrap/#/)**

I created this based on recent work with Angular JS, and I really didn't like the way the Angular Seed project is set up. I decided to create my own boilerplate for creating new Angular applications using a structure and patterns I think work very well.

I decided to open source it and get some feedback from others to try and improve it.

This uses a directory layout I originally found [in this article](https://scotch.io/tutorials/angularjs-best-practices-directory-structure). I have found it to be really nice for setting up larger applications. I also use some different patterns I've found to be helpful as well. 

This uses:


- **[Angular UI-Router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router)**
- **[Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)**
- **[Flatly Theme](https://bootswatch.com/flatly/)**
